My first python real project! web automation
made by Shir Rabi, April 2020
I'm open for notes.
project status: done.

fun fact: I used this program in order to check if there are any changes in the news- on "Ynen broadcasts" page.

inside:
1. pre-running: file "update_db". By inputing url, changes the table in the SQL database so it
would be suitable to the website you are planning to work with. 
If you prefer, you can update the table in the database manually.

2. "main" script- you should run this one.
